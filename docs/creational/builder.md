##ðŸ‘· Builder

The builder pattern is used to create complex objects with constituent parts that must be created in the same order or using a specific algorithm. 
An external class controls the construction algorithm.

**Example:**

```swift
protocol ThreeDimensions {
    var x: Double? {get}
    var y: Double? {get}
    var z: Double? {get}
}

class Point : ThreeDimensions {
    var x: Double?
    var y: Double?
    var z: Double?

    typealias PointBuilderClosure = (Point) -> ()

    init(buildClosure: PointBuilderClosure) {
        buildClosure(self)
    }
}

```
**Usage:**
```swift
let fancyPoint = Point { point in
    point.x = 0.1
    point.y = 0.2
    point.z = 0.3
}

fancyPoint.x
fancyPoint.y
fancyPoint.z
```

Shorter but oh-so-ugly alternative:

```swift
let uglierPoint = Point {
    $0.x = 0.1
    $0.y = 0.2
    $0.z = 0.3
}

let alsoUglyPoint = Point { ($0.x, $0.y, $0.z) = (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) }

```
