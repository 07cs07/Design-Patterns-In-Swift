##üíç Singleton

The singleton pattern ensures that only one object of a particular class is ever created.
All further references to objects of the singleton class refer to the same underlying instance.

**Example:**

```swift
class SingletonClass {
    class var shared : SingletonClass {

        struct Static {
            static let instance : SingletonClass = SingletonClass()
        }

        return Static.instance
    }
}
```
**Usage:**
```swift
let instance = SingletonClass.shared

```
